81,1,1,"I think there are two variables, colour and shape. If the object selected is the only one of the three objects with any one of the variables (eg shape triangle) then it would send the shape rather than colour (eg green). The problem comes if two of the objects have the same shape or colour then it becomes 50/50.",5
82,3,1,"It identified that both triangle and green were relevant to the highlighted image, then would consider whether either of those options would be able to uniquely identify the highlighted object - as two objects are triangles but only the highlighted is green, it would pick the green",4
83,4,2,"the shape seemed to be the main influence for me followed by the colour if it was not white",5
84,2,3,"Figure out what makes each object unique from the other objects. The example below has two triangles, one circle, so the shape doesn't help. However, they each have different colours. Hence ChatGPT will choose a message to send to get the interpreter to choose an option based on the colour. If the colour isn't an option, ChatGPT will send the shape.",5
85,1,1,"a process of ilimination.  There is only one green object.",5
86,2,2,"I think that, if the ChatGPT is thinking the way that I assume it is, I would expect Chat GPT, in this example, to send a green paint emoji as the answer since there are two triangles, so it would not be so helpful to send a triangle image, whereas there is only 1 triangle that is filled in with green.",4
87,3,1,"The chatGTP would solve the task very similar to us.",5
88,1,1,"not sure",3
89,3,1,"ChatGPT looked at the colours available and the shapes to help make the decision. For example in the example below the green triangle needs to be selected, there are 2 triangles and a circle. The triangles are different colours so it is better to direct someone with the colour green to ensure that they make the right selection.",4
90,3,1,"It would decide which option is the most supportive, so in this case it would be the colour green because there is only one green object, whereas if it was to choose 'triangle', it could be the green triangle or the blue triangle.",4
91,2,2,"The shape you are trying to show is a triangle. There are two triangles so choosing this prompt would be ambiguous. The triangle selected in filled in green, it is the only shape that's been filled in green so I would choose that prompt",2
92,1,1,"I think they will pick out the triangle or the green paint based on the initial image they had to work on.",3
93,1,1,"I think it did really well",3
94,4,2,"It would have tried to assess any unique aspects of the image, the colour or the shape. Where there was only one of these in the three images it would share that unique aspect of the image to support the human decision making. 

Where there was more than one image and no single unique identifier it would choose one aspect of the image to share with the user. This would result in a 50/50 choice between the three images.",5
95,4,1,"Not got a clue on this sorry",5
96,1,1,"I think it will have looked at all the possible options and selected the one that indicated the answer while (hopefully) eliminating the uncertainty - eg , triangle could be one of two, but green paint can only result in one answer",4
97,3,2,"1. Check shapes. 
2. If highlighted shape is single and available, send that shape.
3. If shape is multiple, check colours. 
4. If colour is single and available, send colour.
If none of the above is true, it gets more complicated!",4
98,3,2,"triangle",5
99,1,1,"Whether there was more than one triangle
Whether there was more than one green shape. 
Select if possible the option which could only apply to one box",5
100,1,2,"What Shape is highlighted, are there other shapes the same, do the matching shapes have different colours, are all three shapes different colours, if so how will i direct interpreter to pick correct highlighted shape. Select Green Highlight as message as only green shape is highlighted and its the only shape in this colour",5
101,2,1,"Process of elimination - it will choose the shape because the colour green to apply to any shape.",3
102,2,2,"It would have first identified whether any of the objects match the attributes of the highlighted object in terms of shape or colour. After identifying any matching attributes (i.e. two being triangles), it would then see what messages were available and which colour/shape message would correlate to each object being chosen by the interpreter. Upon seeing that the highlighted object is the only green object and green is a message option, they would choose to send the green colour message.",4
103,3,1,"I think Chat GPT will go with selecting the shape instead of the colour. It can get a definite fix on the shape we as the colour data could relate to more than one shape so it will go with the most probable selecton.",4
104,1,1,"green",4
117,2,1,"The GPT would sort by Colour then Shape",4
105,1,1,"it would select the colour as there is only 1 option of the colour green, within the 3 shapes",3
106,2,1,"It will have scanned for a match in the shapes. If there were 2 of the same shape, it would then move to colour.",3
107,2,2,"as there was only 1 green shape it seemed the easiest message to send would be the green as there are 2 triangles",4
108,1,1,"assessing shape/colour",5
109,1,1,"I think It would have worked through the list of attributes and chose the first one that was true. Circle (no), Triangle (yes) So Triangle I believe.",3
110,2,2,"ChatGPT should have picked the green paint as that is most clear that it associates with the green triangle",3
111,1,1,"2 triangles so not a definitive. Only 1 green so decided this would be the correct",4
112,5,1,"Circle and red would be eliminated at options to respond as the highlighted object is green and a triangle. As there are two triangles, that object would be elimitated as a response option. Therefore, green would be chosen as it only applies to one of the images, namely the highlighted one.",3
113,3,1,"they said to communicate that I should choose the green triangle. They could choose triangle but there is also a blue triangle so I wouldn't know which triangle. There is only one green shape so they would choose green.",5
114,3,2,"I think ChatGPT had to analyse probability and gave its instructions purely based on that - probability calculated by analysing both shapes and colour",5
115,1,1,"Identifying characteristics of highlighted image: green + triangle.
2 triangles in line-up, green + blue, therefore triangle does not equal a certainty.
therefore green = certainty, choose green as a message.",4
116,2,1,"I believe it would try and mirror the shape as closely as possible. I believe ChatGPT would focus firstly on the shape which is a triangle. However because there were two triangles available, blue and green, it would then look to select the green paint because the message they are trying to send is only the colour available. It would also be the strongest indicator because the highlighted object is green.",4
118,3,1,"ChatGPT is a master of this.",4
119,1,1,"First determine how many of the same shape, then how many of the same colour, then choose the least conflicting one.",5
120,1,1,"I think it would choose the green paint because it rules out any other options. For example if it chose the triangle, it could give two possible answers instead of just one.",3
